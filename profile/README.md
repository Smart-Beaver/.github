## Hi there 👋

Welcome to Smart Beaver, a tool designed to simplify and streamline the process of generating code for smart contracts.
Whether you're an experienced blockchain developer or just getting started with smart contract development, Smart Beaver helps you to create efficient and secure smart contract code with ease.

We generate code in the ink! language without the use of any additional libraries. This ensures that your smart contracts are written in a clean and efficient manner. 
Now you don't have to worry about external dependencies.

### What can be generated
* PSP-22
* PSP-34 (work in progress)
* PSP-37 (coming soon)
